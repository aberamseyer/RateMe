# RateMe

A social media application based on Season 3 Episode 1 of the Netflix Series Black Mirror. It aims to have a little more fun with the concept of rating users by using facial recognition and nearby device detection to find users.

8/27/2018: This application currently doesn't work because the facial recognition service it uses disabled its free tier of plans. Because this was only an experiment, I won't be updating it to work with a different service unless I revisit it for fun sometime in the future.
